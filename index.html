              Western Kazakhstan, which contain more than 25 billion barrels of
              oil and 61 TCF of Gas. TCO is operator of the Fields. The FGP
              (Future Growth Project) is major expansion of TCO’s oil production
              capacity. The expansion feature three new facilities: 3GP,
              Pressure Boost Facility (PBF) and Sour Gas Injection Plant (3GI).
              The capacity of the FGP process facilities is 33,420 TPD of
              stabilized oil and 1,072 MNm3/h (960 MMSCFD) of injected gas. The
              injected gas discharged from the injection compressors at 3GI
              facility to the multi well injection pad via injection gas
